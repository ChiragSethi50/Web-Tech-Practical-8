        <h2>After procedure</h2>
        <ol type="1" style="line-height: 1.7em;">
           <li> After donating you sit in an observation area, where you rest and eat a light snack. After 15 minutes, you can leave. After your blood donation:

            
           <li> Avoid strenuous physical activity or heavy lifting for the next five hours.
            <li>If you feel lightheaded, lie down with your feet up until the feeling passes.
            Keep the bandage on your arm and dry for five hours.
            <li>If you have bleeding after removing the bandage, put pressure on the site and raise your arm until the bleeding stops.
            <li>If bleeding or bruising occurs under the skin, apply a cold pack to the area periodically during the first 24 hours.
            <li>If your arm is sore, take a pain reliever such as acetaminophen (Tylenol, others). Avoid taking aspirin or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) for the first 24 to 48 hours after donation.
            <li>Contact the blood donor center or your doctor if you forgot to report any important health information before you donated or if you had any problems or needed medical care after giving blood.
            
            <li>You should also call the center if you:
            
            Continue to feel nauseated, lightheaded or dizzy after resting, eating and drinking.
            Notice a raised bump, continued bleeding or pain at the needle-stick site when you remove the bandage.
            Feel pain or tingling down your arm, into your fingers.
            Become ill with signs and symptoms of a cold or flu, such as fever, headache or sore throat, within four days after your blood donation. Bacterial infections can be transmitted by your blood to another person via transfusion, so it's important to let the blood donor center know if you become ill so that your blood won't be used.

            

<li>Drink plenty of fluids to replenish the volume lost during donation.
Avoid lifting heavy weights with the donation arm or participating in strenuous physical activities or sports after donation to prevent bruising of the venepuncture site and dizziness.


<li>Take a seat or lie down immediately, preferably with your feet raised, until the feeling passes.
<li>Loosen any restrictive garments and keep breathing smoothly.
Keep calm and take slow and long deep breaths.
Seek assistance from any passer-by or people near you.
<li>If the condition does not improve or for any reason something doesn't feel right, call the number provided above.


<li>In uncommon situations where fresh bleeding occurs after the plaster is removed, put gentle pressure on the venepuncture site, raise your arm for 3â€“5 minutes and apply a bandage to the site. The bandage or the dressing can be removed after 5 hours.
<li>If you notice bruising around the venepuncture site, it is usually caused by bleeding into the tissue underneath the skin. It will usually resolve in a week's time. If you feel pain or discomfort, applying a cold compress to the area may help.
<li>If the venepuncture site becomes swollen or blue or you experience pain or numbness in the donation arm, please call (insert telephone number) for advice or consult a doctor.
