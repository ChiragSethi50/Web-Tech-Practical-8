        <h2>Blood Donation Facts</h2>
        <h3>Why Your Donation Matters</h3>
        <ol type="a" style="line-height: 1.5em;">
        There are no substitutes for blood, platelets or plasma—they cannot be manufactured. Patients in need of blood or blood products must rely on donations from people like you. Those who are hesitant about donating blood for the first time often find that the donation process is easy and that saving lives is deeply gratifying.<br><br>
        
        One donation can save multiple lives. Here are the facts:<br><br>
        
        <li>Just 1 donation can save up to 3 lives.
        <li>The average red blood cell transfusion is 3 pints (or 3 whole-blood donations).
        <li>More than 1 million people every year are diagnosed with cancer for the first time. Many of them will need blood—sometimes daily—during chemotherapy.
        <li>More than 38,000 blood donations are needed every day.
       <li> Type O-negative whole blood can be transfused to people with any blood type, but this type of blood is rare, and supplies of it are low.
        <li>Type AB plasma can be transfused to patients with all other blood types, but it's also in short supply.
        <li>While 38% of the American population is eligible to give blood, only 2% actually donates.
        </ol>
        <h3>Blood Facts in General</h3>
        <ol style="display: block; text-align: justify;line-height: 1.7em;" type="1">
<li>There is no substitute for human Blood
<li>Blood makes up about 7% of your body's weight.
<li>An average adult has about 14 to 18 pints of Blood.
<li>One standard unit or pint of Blood equals about two cups.
<li>Blood carries oxygen and nutrients to all of the body.
<li>Blood carries carbon dioxide and other waste products back to the lungs, kidneys and liver for disposal.</li>
<li>Blood fights against infection and helps heal wounds.
<li>One unit of donated whole Blood is separated into components before use (red Blood cells, white Blood cells, plasma, platelets, etc.)
<li>There are four main Blood types: A, B, AB and O.
<li>Each Blood type is either Rh positive or negative.
<li>There are about one billion red Blood cells in a few drops of whole Blood.
<li>Red Blood cells live about 120 days in our bodies.
<li>Red Blood cells can be stored under normal conditions for up to 42 days.
<li>Frozen red Blood cells can be stored for ten years, and more.
<li>Platelets must be used within five days.
<li>Platelets are small Blood cells that assist in the process of Blood clotting helping those with leukemia and other cancers, controlling bleeding.
<li>Plasma, the fourth major component of Blood, is a sticky, pale yellow fluid mixture of water, protein and salts. It is 95% water. The other 5% is made up of nutrients, proteins and hormones.
<li>Blood Plasma constitutes 55% of the volume of human Blood.
<li>Plasma helps maintain Blood pressure, carries Blood cells, nutrients, enzymes and hormones, and supplies critical proteins for Blood clotting and immunity.
<li>Type AB plasma has been considered as the universal Blood plasma type, and therefore AB plasma is given to patients with any Blood type.
<li>Frozen Plasma can be stored for up to one year.
<li>Human Blood; red Blood cells, white Blood cells, plasma and platelets are made naturally by the body in the bone marrow.
